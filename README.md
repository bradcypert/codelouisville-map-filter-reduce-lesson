> A lesson and practice on map/filter/reduce

Please ensure that you've installed NodeJS locally on your machine.

In your text editor, please open index.js and find 6 functions. Each of these functions have comments above them explaining what the given input and output of those functions should be. Each will take in an array (the contents of that array are described in the comments above the function).

Your goal is to write the function bodies that solve the problem listed in the comments above each function. Do not modify the function names. Do not modify the exports section at the bottom of the file. All the changes that you need to make will be in the body of those functions.

To test your solutions, please open this directory via terminal, powershell, command prompt / etc, and run `npm i && npm run test`. My solutions can be found in the `index-solutions.js` file. They are there for guidance if you need it, or if you get yours working and want to compare.

If you have questions, please reach out to me on slack.
